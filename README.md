# traffic-assignment-from-scratch
understand how popular travel modeling packages work by implementing their algorithms from scratch with python


- guiding principles
  - audience: practicing professionals who use travel modeling packages for their work
  - simplicity and clarity: the top priority when implementing the algorithms
    is that they are easy to understand. Performance considerations should only be a 
    side note or afterthought. Basic programming techniques should be chosen over
    sophisicated ones.
  - assignment: we only cover the assignment portion of travel modeling. we do not cover
    demand, distribution, mode choice, etc
  - visualization: algorithms should be illustrated with interesting visualizations, animations,
    interactions, etc.
  - Python and IPython: algorithms should be implemented in IPthon notebooks, with narrative.
  - references: references for algorithms should be given, but no reference is better than 
    a reference that is not suberbly helpful and well-written. Tutorial-type references 
    should have preference over original references.
  - popular packages: packages that use an algorithm (or some variation of it) should be 
    discussed in the notebook for that algorithm
  - completeness: the note books should help users build an accurate mental model of the
    entire traffic assignment landscape.


- topics to cover
  - approaches for modeling networks
  - static and dynamic assignment
  - micro, meso, and macro assignment
